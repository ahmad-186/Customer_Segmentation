🛍️ Customer Segmentation on Shopping Trends Dataset

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on Customer Segmentation using the Customer Shopping Trends Dataset.
The goal is to identify different groups of customers based on their demographics and purchasing behavior, which can help businesses:

Understand customer needs better

Personalize marketing campaigns

Improve product recommendations

Enhance overall customer experience

⚙️ Workflow

Data Preprocessing

Handled missing values and duplicates

Encoded categorical features & scaled numerical features

Used ColumnTransformer for efficient transformations

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Univariate & bivariate analysis of demographics and purchases

Visualized spending patterns with Matplotlib & Seaborn

Clustering (KMeans)

Applied KMeans to group customers

Determined optimal clusters using Elbow Method & Silhouette Analysis

Model Evaluation

Silhouette Score

Davies-Bouldin Index

Calinski-Harabasz Score

Visualization & Insights

Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction

Visualized clusters in 2D

Profiled clusters to derive customer personas

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python 🐍

pandas, numpy

matplotlib, seaborn

scikit-learn
